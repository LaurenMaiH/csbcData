Pretty much anything you can think of! Some examples of custom work I‚Äôve done before:
- **School-to-School Comparison**: Compare the averages of two schools side-by-side in a bar graph. Similar to the üìä **Bar Chart** tab, but focused on school-to-school average comparisons instead of school-to-division. This visual tool is an excellent way to see how you measure up against your competitors.

- **Scoreboard**: Stay updated on your standings in any category. View the complete leaderboard for any category at any point during the season.

- **Tailored Competitor Analysis Algorithm**: Identify the schools to focus on using a custom algorithm designed to pinpoint your primary competitors (those you frequently compete against), strongest competitors (those dominating the division), and similar competitors (schools that score similarly to yours and are your main rivals).
        
And much more, tailored to your specific questions and needs.
